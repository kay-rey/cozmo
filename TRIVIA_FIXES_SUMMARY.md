# Trivia Game Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **1. Active Game Cleanup Bug**

**Problem**: When trivia games timed out, they weren't being removed from the active games list, causing "Game Already Active" errors.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced `_handle_trivia_timeout()` to clean up both enhanced and simple games
- Enhanced `_handle_challenge_timeout()` to clean up both enhanced and simple games
- Added proper game state cleanup on timeout

**Code Changes**:

- Added game cleanup logic to timeout handlers
- Clears both `game_manager` games and `active_games` dictionary entries
- Added comprehensive logging for timeout cleanup

### ✅ **2. True/False Answer Support**

**Problem**: True/false questions weren't being handled - only multiple choice reactions worked.

**Solution**:

- Updated question filtering to include both "multiple_choice" and "true_false" types
- Added ✅ (True) and ❌ (False) reaction support
- Enhanced reaction handler to process true/false answers
- Updated embed generation for true/false questions

**Code Changes**:

- Modified question selection to include true/false questions
- Added true/false embed formatting with ✅/❌ options
- Enhanced reaction mapping to handle both multiple choice and true/false
- Updated answer validation and response generation

### ✅ **3. Admin Tools for Game Management**

**Added**: New admin commands to help manage stuck games.

**New Commands**:

- `!cleargames [channel_id]` - Manually clear stuck games (admin only)
- `!triviadebug` - Enhanced debug info showing game states and permissions

## How It Works Now

- Users click ✅ for True or ❌ for False
- Bot responds with correct/incorrect and shows the answer

### **Timeout Handling**

- Proper cleanup of both enhanced and simple game states

### **Admin Tools**

## Available Question Types

The trivia system now supports:

1. **Multiple Choice** (🇦 🇧 🇨 🇩 reactions)

   - 4 options to choose from
   - React with the letter corresponding to your answer

2. **True/False** (✅ ❌ reactions)
   - Statement-based questions
   - React with ✅ for True or ❌ for False
