  - Testing guidelines

#### `docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

- **Purpose**: Step-by-step deployment checklist
- **Contents**:
  - Pre-deployment phase checklist
  - Deployment phase procedures
  - Post-deployment verification
  - Rollback procedures
  - Sign-off requirements
  - Emergency contacts and commands

### 6. Configuration Management

#### `config/production.env.template`

- **Purpose**: Production environment configuration template
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive configuration options
  - Security best practices
  - Performance tuning parameters
  - Feature flags
  - Monitoring configuration
  - Deployment metadata

## Database Schema Enhancements

### Performance Indexes Added

```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_users_points_streak ON users (total_points DESC, current_streak DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_difficulty_category ON questions (difficulty, category);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_performance ON questions (times_asked, times_correct);
CREATE INDEX idx_game_sessions_user_time ON game_sessions (user_id, start_time DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_weekly_rankings_week_rank ON weekly_rankings (week_start, rank);

-- Challenge-specific indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_daily_challenge ON users (daily_challenge_completed);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_weekly_challenge ON users (weekly_challenge_completed);

-- Performance tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_success_rate ON questions (CAST(times_correct AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(times_asked, 0));
```

### Database Configuration Optimizations

- **WAL Mode**: Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency
- **Cache Size**: 64MB cache for improved performance
- **Synchronous Mode**: NORMAL for balanced safety/performance
- **Busy Timeout**: 30 seconds for handling concurrent access
- **Foreign Keys**: Enabled for data integrity

## Data Preservation Features

### User Data Protection

- All migrations preserve existing user statistics
- Achievement unlocks are maintained
- Historical game data is preserved
- Ranking information is retained

### Backup Strategy

- **Automated Backups**: Daily and weekly backups
- **Migration Backups**: Pre and post-migration backups
- **Retention Policy**: Configurable backup retention
- **Verification**: All backups are integrity-checked
- **Metadata**: Backup metadata for tracking and analysis

### Recovery Mechanisms

- **Emergency Recovery**: Automatic recovery from latest valid backup
- **Rollback Procedures**: Documented rollback for failed deployments
- **Data Validation**: Pre and post-migration data validation
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Continuous database integrity checking

## Testing and Validation
